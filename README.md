# Student House BV

This is a collaborative project for which we were given a prompt about multiple problems encountered in different housing situations. We had to define the problem statement and build an IT solution that would improve the current situation of the housing agency. Our solution consists of a desktop application that would centralize all house rules, a system to keep track of task assignment and shared supplies management, a communication channel between the tenants and their landlord as well as a built-in planner for custom activities.
<br/><br/>Team size: 4 people, Project duration: 8 weeks, Position: Team Leader

## Account Types
The application supports two different account types: **tenants**,  which, in our case, are students, and **supervisors**. The latter are either the landlords or different people designed by the housing agency to check the status of the properties. The users have similar interfaces, but with different purposes that, when combined, create a direct communication channel between the two entities.

### Tenant Features
* Overview page with house rules and contact info for quick access
* Planner to see all upcoming events
* Supplies management for an easier way to centralize common expenses
* Report page for submitting any issues that would require a supervisor's attention and receiving warnings

### Supervisor Features
* Rules page with the purpose of creating a predefined ruleset for the tenants
* Contact info management
* Planner for informing the tenants about upcoming events 
* Reports management page with the option to issue warnings when necessary

## Programming Languages

* C# .NET Framework for backend
* Windows Forms Library for the GUI
* XML serialization for persistance
