# Student House BV

This is a collaborative project for which we were given a prompt about multiple problems encountered in different housing situations. We had to define the problem statement and build an IT solution that would improve the current situation of the housing agency. Our solution consists of a desktop application that would centralize all house rules, a system to keep track of task assignment and shared supplies management, a communication channel between the tenants and their landlord as well as a built-in planner for custom activities.
